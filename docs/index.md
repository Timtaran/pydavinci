# pydavinci

A lightly opinionated, type-hinted wrapper for Davinci Resolve's Python API.
*I really just wanted auto completion in the IDE*

## Installation

Install via the command:
```
pip install pydavinci
```
!!! info
    pydavinci only works with Python 3.6 as that is a requirement by Davinci Resolve itself :(
